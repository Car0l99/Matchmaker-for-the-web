<h2>It might not be month of love, but love will always be around us whether it's romantic or platonic. This quiz determines what you and I are meant to be. Friends? Foes? Lovers? Don't worry it's not too long, just five simple questions. If you very strongly agree with the statement I present to you answer a 5, if you just agree answer a 4, if you are indifferent answer a 3, if you disagree answer a 2 & if you very strongly disagree with what I have presented to you then answer a 1. So take a chance and let us gamble with the fates.</h2>
